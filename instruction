take 1: for the realization of this test I decided to use react-redux as well as having a database in Mlab to keep the user since it was not required to make a login, a seed could have been created but I preferred to use the mlab, for the design it was used materialize react as a library as well as the react-redux and a tool to check the state of redux in the browser
import {composeWithDevTools} from 'redux-devtools-extension';

the part of the edition can not do 100 since in postman it reviews and updates me but from my front I can not do it
